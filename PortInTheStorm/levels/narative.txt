Tutorial 1:
Grandfather: *cough* Granddaughter, I need your help. The other tower lights
are down and I can just see

Granddaughter: Right away!

Grandfather: Wait, *cough* take me with you, you have never done this in a
storm before!

Granddaughter: It's the same as in a clear night.

Grandfather: Yes, but the stakes are higher, now tell be how to operate
the projector while we climb.

Tutorial 2:
Grandfather: I was a sailor long ago, I became a lighthouse keeper after being
guided to shore by one of these very lighthouses.

Granddaughter: On the Sea Mule?

Grandfather: A dreary but trusty ship, it sailed for many more years than I
did. But make sure to pass the beam close to the ships. They are powerful
but very focused and it is easy to miss them.

Tutorial 3:
Grandfather: Few lighthouses have their own light source out here. It was
easier to redirect a beam than create a new one.

Granddaughter: According to this log file there should be a passenger ship
on the other side of that fog bank.

Grandfather: And now we must trust our fellows to guide that ship home.
